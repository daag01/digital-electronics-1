## Preparation tasks (done before the lab at home)

Consider the clock enable circuit from previous laboratories and find out the values of its parameter `g_MAX` so that the output signal `ce_o` has the frequency 100&nbsp;Hz or 1&nbsp;kHz. Let the frequency of the main clock signal be 100&nbsp;MHz.

   | **Frequency** | **Number of clk periods (g_MAX)** | **Number of clk periods in hex** | **Number of clk periods in binary** |
   | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |
   | 100&nbsp;Hz | | |
   | 1000&nbsp;Hz | | |
